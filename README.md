## ⚖️ Comparative Strategic Evaluation

| Dimension | Google Glass | Apple Newton |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| Market Timing | AI & cloud-ready era | Too early for ecosystem maturity |
| Revenue Recovery | Successful enterprise pivot | No direct monetization |
| Data Assets | Large-scale AR and CV data | Limited data capture |
| Ecosystem Leverage | Strong Google platform integration | Standalone product |
| Strategic Spillover | Android XR, AR leadership | Mobile computing foundation |

**Overall Insight:**  
Google Glass generated **immediate enterprise value**, while Apple Newton delivered **long-term foundational innovation**.
